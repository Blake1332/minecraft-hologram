To use the music disc player functionality its quite convoluted due to the limitations of vanilla Minecraft

There are some hard limits:

If you want audio you need to replace a current music disc track using a resource pack. I am using jukeboxes and there are some limits:
-We cannot add new disc(wont be able to join on vanilla client
-Max audio track is the length of the disc, so for disc blocks like I'm using audio cuts out after 5:45 mins. (And disc cat only can have audio of 3:05 mins, so on)
-Can only support as many videos as there are music disc WITH THE MAX AUDIO TRACK TIME OF EACH DISK

-The frames need to be extracted you can use the extract_video_frames python script. The frames will be added to a file on the server in your plugins folder.

The mod will compile with outdoing this, but it wont work so just ignore it if you dont want it



I am currently looking for a work around, testing with redownloading resource pack using pipeline but very un-user friendly and high server bandwidth.
Very experimental. This is just a fun code project for the week (:
